# python_perftest

Set of python benchamrks to compare performance of python 2.7, 3.6 and 3.7. 

Docker must be installed in order to run tests. If you have docker, then run following command:
```
sh run_all.sh
```
Results of benchmarks will be stored to `logs` directory. If you don't want to run and wait for results you can just see my results in `results` directory :)
